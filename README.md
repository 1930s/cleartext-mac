# Cleartext for Mac
A text editor that only allows the 1,000 most common words in English

I just got Randall Monroe's new book <a href="https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/">Thing Explainer</a>. Only using the top 1,000 words makes the text really easy to read. I thought I would make it easy for people to write like this, so I made this application.
